ADNOC Distribution delivered on a critical commitment to the
capital markets and generated record-high EBITDA in 2023
In 2023, ADNOC Distribution achieved the highest ever EBITDA of AED 3,680 million, an increase of 4.6% year-
on-year. Net profit of AED 2,601 million, while down 5.4% year-on-year, fully covers the dividend for 2023 of
AED 2.57 billion as per the dividend policy(*)
. Underlying EBITDA grew by 15.4% year-on-year to AED 3,340
million, and net profit excluding inventory movements increased by 6.4% year-on-year to AED 2,262 million
despite higher depreciation charge and finance costs. This financial performance was supported by a double-
digit growth in fuel volumes and a number of non-fuel transactions, growing contribution from international
operations (KSA and Egypt) and efficiency improvement initiatives. Strong underlying profitability contributed to
the growth in free cashflow generation of 18.7% to AED 4,025 million in 2023. Together with a robust balance
sheet (net debt/EBITDA of 0.62x as of 31 December 2023) this provides support to future growth prospects in
line with the new 2024-28 strategy recently approved by the Board of Directors. ADNOC Distribution will
communicate new targets during the upcoming Capital Markets Day in February 2024.
(*) subject to shareholders’ approval
Fuel business (retail and commercial)
ADNOC Distribution’s UAE and KSA retail and corporate fuel volumes increased in 2023 by 11.8% year-on-year
to a new record of above 11 billion liters supported by region’s economic growth and higher mobility. New
stations in Dubai and network renovation in Saudi Arabia resulted in incremental retail fuel volumes. This,
together with economic growth momentum and higher mobility led to a 9.6% increase in retail fuel volumes in
the UAE and KSA compared to 2022. Including operations in Egypt, ADNOC Distribution recorded a 40.1%
year-on-year increase in the total fuel volumes to nearly 14 billion liters.
Network expansion: ADNOC Distribution continued to expand its retail fuel network in 2023 by adding 41 new
stations, and exceeded a full-year 2023 target to open 25-35 new stations across its network.
o Domestically: ADNOC Distribution added 31 new stations in the UAE to reach 529 stations (2022: 502),
an increase of 5.4% year-on-year
In Dubai, the Company opened 5 new stations in 2023. As a result, ADNOC Distribution’s service station
network in the emirate expanded by 2.8
1 % to 44 stations compared to 39 at the end of 2022
o Internationally: ADNOC Distribution continued to execute on its plans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with
68 stations at the end of 2023, while c.85% of the network has been rebranded, providing support to
operating and financial performance in KSA
During 2023, the Company’s assets in Egypt added 4 new service stations to the portfolio and operated 243
service stations. In addition, the Egypt portfolio comprised aviation fuel, lubricant and wholesale fuel
operations as well as 100+ convenience stores, 250+ lube changing points and 15+ car wash locations
o Total network of ADNOC Distribution expanded by 1.5x to reach 840 stations (2022: 568)
Commercial business: In 2023, commercial segment fuel volumes in the UAE increased by 16.2% compared
to 2022 driven by an increase of 17.1% year-on-year in corporate business volumes. This was a result of
execution of new contracts signed in 2022-23, as the Company has been proactively focusing on gaining market
share in Dubai and Northern Emirates.
The total number of export network countries in ADNOC Distribution’s VOYAGER lubricants portfolio rose to 37
markets at the end of 2023 compared to 25 markets at the end of the same period last year. The Company is
exploring opportunities to penetrate new growing lubricant markets through collaboration with leading partners
worldwide.

ADNOC Classification: Public
Additionally, in 2023 the Company launched ADNOC Voyager brand signature range of premium and OEM-
approved automotive vehicle lubricants in Egypt through TotalEnergies Marketing Egypt. The products will be
available for the Egyptian consumers to purchase at ADNOC branded service stations.
Non-fuel business - UAE
During 2023, ADNOC Distribution in line with the non-fuel retail strategy implemented a series of marketing
campaigns and customer-centric initiatives. The Company continued to enhance customer experience through
various initiatives, such as offering a modern shopping environment, improvement in category management, a
better assortment of products, including introduction of fresh food and premium coffee products, and digital
channels to order and transact.
In addition, the Company executed on its convenience store revitalization program, with additional 15 stores
refurbished during 2023. Since the launch of the program, the Company modernized c.210 ADNOC Oasis stores
over 2020-23, offering fresh food, barista-brewed coffee and a wider menu selection. This led to a record-high
convenience store conversion rate in four years of 24.7%, which implies an increase of 300 bps compared to
2022, and supported a 12.9% year-on-year increase in non-fuel transactions.
ADNOC Distribution expanded its vehicle inspection services in the UAE to 34 centres following an addition of
two new centres between end of 2022 and end of 2023. The number of vehicles inspected (fresh tests) in the
Company’s vehicle inspection centres increased by 48.9% in 2023 year-on-year, driven by an increase of the
number of vehicle inspection centres, particularly in the Northern Emirates, along with the introduction of new
services, and supported by marketing and promotions.
ADNOC Rewards loyalty program and customer focus
ADNOC Distribution is committed to putting customers at the heart of what it does to help accelerate the mobility
revolution and redefine the experience at service stations; thereby, cementing the Company’s position as a
destination of choice for its customers.
ADNOC Rewards loyalty program welcomed c.350 thousand new members in 2023 with the total enrolled
members of more than 1.9 million (+22% year-on-year). Over 100 partners provide discounts and deals through
the ADNOC Distribution app. This growth was partially supported last year by an improvement in generosity of
3X. New system of ADNOC Rewards tiers was introduced in 2023: SILVER, GOLD, and PLATINUM – each
delivering an expanded suite of exciting benefits and offers to customers.
As part of the loyalty programme, the Company offers its customers promotions in-store, and a range of
initiatives that include linking ADNOC Rewards across service station purchases and allowing customers to earn
and redeem points against valuable offerings – in fuel, lube change services, convenience store, and car
washes. All this contributed to growth in the non-fuel business.
The Company has also become the region’s first fuel distributor to introduce the innovative ADNOC ‘Fill & Go’
technology at its service stations. The AI-backed solution utilizes the latest innovations in computer vision
technologies, comprising machine learning models allowing computers to recognize vehicles, and responds by
offering a hyper-personalized fuelling experience, reaffirming ADNOC Distribution’s leadership position in the
UAE’s fuel and convenience retail sector.

OPEX
During 2023, ADNOC Distribution accelerated execution of efficiency improvement initiatives across all its
operations and businesses including optimizing logistics costs, renegotiations of supply contracts with vendors,
etc. In 2023 the Company achieved like-for-like OPEX savings of AED 103 million, above guidance of AED 92
million. As a result, the Company’s cash OPEX remained unchanged compared to 2022, despite the continued
expansion of the Company’s operations and associated costs. In particular, number of stations in the UAE and
KSA increased by 5.1% at the end of 2023 compared to the same period of last year. In addition, ADNOC
Distribution consolidated operations of TotalEnergies Marketing Egypt from February 2023.
Efficient capital allocation
ADNOC Distribution invested AED 1.18 billion in 2023 vs. guidance of AED 0.9-1.1 billion (excl. M&A). The
company expects to invest AED 0.9-1.1 billion in 2024 (excl. M&A).
ADNOC Distribution has demonstrated a proven track-record of value creation since IPO, by pursuing new
opportunities in domestic and international markets and allocating cash towards growth. Through efficient capital
allocation, the Company has consistently achieved healthy rates of return, including Return on Capital Employed
(ROCE) of 26.3% in 2023 (28.5% in 2022) and Return on Equity (ROE) of 74.9% in 2023 (79.8% in 2022). The
year-on-year reduction in return metrics was a result of lower inventory gains of AED 339 million in 2023
compared to inventory gains of AED 622 million in 2022 in a fast rising oil price environment.
In 2023, ADNOC Distribution generated robust free cash flow of AED 4,025 million, an increase of 18.7% year-
on-year. At the end of December 2023, the Company maintained a strong financial position with liquidity of AED
6 billion in the form of AED 3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and AED 2.8 billion in unutilized credit facility.
The balance sheet remained strong with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.62x as of 31 December 2023 (0.78x as
of 31 December 2022).
Eng. Bader Al Lamki – Chief Executive Officer:
“Fueled by our record EBITDA of over USD 1 billion, 2023 was a remarkable and transformative year for ADNOC
Distribution. Our team delivered on a critical commitment made to capital markets, underpinned by our focus on
execution excellence, future-proofing the business, unwavering dedication to health safety and environment,
and by our capability building and cultural transformation. This achievement is underscored by our focus on
execution excellence and future-proofing the business.
Looking ahead, ADNOC Distribution’s Board of Directors has approved a new five-year strategy for 2024-28,
targeting the next phase of growth with a focus on sustainable mobility and convenience. It includes optimizing
existing assets to improve our profitability, doubling down on non-fuel retail, and generating new revenue
streams offered by energy transition to future-proof our business and increase customer satisfaction. I look
forward to sharing more details about our five-year strategy during the upcoming Capital Markets Day in
February 2024.

Management focus: Continue to deliver incremental growth
through operational excellence and futureproofing the business
With the record in 2023 and attractive shareholder payback, ADNOC Distribution continues to represent a
compelling investment case. After delivering on a critical commitment to Capital Markets of generating in 2023
in excess of $1 billion (AED 3.68 billion) EBITDA, the Company expects solid outlook for full year 2024 and
beyond, underpinned by volume growth momentum, higher contribution of non-fuel retail, and growth in
international operations. In its quest to futureproof the business, the Company is rapidly developing fast EV
charging infrastructure across its UAE network. In addition, ADNOC Distribution continues to explore further
growth opportunities in mobility and lifestyle as well as new revenue streams created through energy transition.
The Company’s growth ambitions are underpinned by a solid macroeconomic backdrop. After posting a 7.9%
increase in GDP in 2022 (including non-oil GDP of 7.2%), a 5.9% growth in the UAE non-oil GDP in 9M 2023
indicates ongoing economic expansion. Our main market Abu Dhabi GDP grew by 2.8% in 9M 2023 year-on-
year (including non-oil GDP of 8.6%) supported by private consumption boosted by population growth and
tourism rebound. Dubai GDP increased by 3.3%, including strong performance from accommodation and food
services activities (+11.1%), transportation and storage services (+10.9%), and information and
communications sector (+4.4%).
In 11 months of 2023, international visitor numbers to Dubai reached 15.37 million, up 20% year-on-year and
2.5% above the level of 2019. The recovery is also supported by hotel indicators, with occupancy and revenue
per available room all above the pre-COVID levels. Hotels occupancy levels increased to 75.6% in the first 11
months of 2023 compared to 71.5% in full-year 2022. Revenue per available room in the period was 25% higher
year-on-year in Abu Dhabi and 4.4% higher year-on-year in Dubai.
According to IMF, a near-term outlook is positive for the UAE but subject to elevated global risks and uncertainty.
The agency estimates that the country’s real GDP increased by 3.4% in 2023 and will grow by 4.0% in 2024
which is the highest rate among the GCC economies. IMF estimates that non-oil GDP growth in the UAE
exceeded 4% in 2023 and will remain at a similar pace in 2024, driven by tourism, construction, and real estate
related developments.
Beyond the strong macroeconomic indicators, business activity expansion has translated into higher traffic and
improved consumer confidence across the country resulting in higher fuel volumes and number of non-fuel
transactions for ADNOC Distribution in 2023. Leveraging on its leadership position in the UAE, customer focus
and best-in-class mobility and lifestyle experience, the Company has grown its fuel volumes at a faster rate than
the country’s GDP growth, increasing 2023 retail fuel volumes in the GCC markets by 9.6% and commercial
volumes by 16.2% year-on-year.
Fuel business
New stations: after exceeding the 2023 target of opening 25-35 stations by adding 41 new stations, the
Company expects to add 15-20 new stations across its network in 2024.
Saudi Arabia: with a fully operational team on the ground, the Company is nearing completion of revitalization
and rebranding programme for its network in the Kingdom.
Egypt: ADNOC Distribution’s acquisition of a 50% stake in TotalEnergies Marketing Egypt reaffirms the
Company’s commitment to expanding business in attractive international growth markets. Egypt’s retail fuel,
lubricants and aviation markets are highly attractive with a potential for future growth. Nine service stations were
re-branded to ADNOC in Cairo in 2023 and further openings are targeted during 2024.

ADNOC Classification: Public
Renewal of the Refined Products Supply Agreement: at the beginning of 2023, ADNOC Distribution
successfully renewed its supply agreement with ADNOC for a new five-year term, reaffirming the Company’s
strong value proposition driven by predictable margins and highly cash generative core business. The renewal
also demonstrated strong and ongoing support from the majority shareholder, ADNOC.
Non-fuel business
ADNOC Distribution focuses on extracting additional growth and value by sweating the assets, providing
enhanced customer experience and shifting capital towards mobility and lifestyle. By offering a modern
environment and a better assortment of products to customers, including fresh food and premium coffee, bundle
offers and digital channels to order and transact, the Company is transforming its stations into a “Destination of
choice”.
ADNOC Distribution invests in offering customers a modern and engaging retail experience. The convenience
store revitalization program has ensured that the Company is positioned to capitalize on benefits of its customer-
centric initiatives and generates consistent growth in its convenience stores business.
Operating and investment efficiency
ADNOC Distribution aims to become one of the leading cost-efficient fuel retailers and remains on track to
reduce structural costs, make its operations leaner and more efficient. The key drivers for OPEX savings include
staff optimization, with the more efficient deployment of staffing levels for stations and convenience stores,
energy efficiency through smart technology, outsourcing of logistics, centralization of key functions, etc.
Sustainability & futureproofing of business
I/ Rollout of Electric Vehicles (EV) charging points
In 2023, the Company accelerated rollout of EV chargers with 53 fast charging points installed across its service
stations at strategic locations in the UAE to address current EV customer demand and offer enhanced customer
value proposition.
ADNOC Distribution continues to expand its network of EV charging stations, and has agreed with TAQA, one
of the largest listed integrated utility companies in the EMEA region, to work together to establish a new mobility
joint-venture. Through the development of modern mobility solutions, ADNOC Distribution intends to become a
destination of choice for charging and convenience for the UAE customers.
II/ Decarbonization roadmap
ADNOC Distribution plans to expand its sustainability-driven efforts to futureproof its business. In January 2023,
the Company unveiled its Decarbonization roadmap, committing to a reduction of carbon intensity of its
operations by 25% by 2030. The Decarbonization roadmap covers Scope 1 emissions which come directly from
the Company’s operations, and Scope 2 carbon emissions which come from the energy ADNOC Distribution
uses to run its operations.
9 | P a g e
ADNOC Classification: Public
The Company aims to cut emissions through a set of identified initiatives that will be implemented in 2024 and
beyond, such as installing solar panels at service stations, use of biofuels to power its fleet of vehicles and other
energy optimization initiatives. ADNOC Distribution also aims to utilize ‘green concrete’, that is eco-friendly and
has a smaller carbon footprint than traditional concrete, in the construction of new service stations.
ADNOC Distribution started installation of solar panels across its service stations network in Dubai, as part of
the Company’s phased approach to UAE-wide solar rollout to provide the power needed for daily operations,
and already installed them at 26 stations in 2023.
Additionally, 100% of the Company’s UAE heavy fleet is now using biofuel.
In 2023, ADNOC Distribution started operation of the region’s first high-speed green hydrogen pilot refuelling
station opened by ADNOC, to test a fleet of zero-emission hydrogen-powered vehicles. The station creates
green hydrogen from water using an electrolyser powered by clean grid electricity, and will be certified as “green”
from solar sources by the International REC Standard, an internationally recognized certification
organization. The pilot will be used to gather data to understand the long-term viability of hydrogen vehicles in
the UAE.
III/ Sustainability Linked Loan
ADNOC Distribution became the first UAE fuel and convenience retailer to tap into sustainable financing, by
converting in January 2023 an existing AED 5.5 billion ($ 1.5 billion) term loan into a Sustainability Linked Loan.
The Company committed to a penalty/incentive model which ties the loan to the sustainability-linked indicators,
including GHG emissions intensity and share of renewable energy contribution. By arranging the Sustainability
Linked Loan, ADNOC Distribution has aligned its funding strategy with the sustainability roadmap.
Dividend policy
ADNOC Distribution is committed to delivering sustainable, profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns.
The Company’s continued growth and robust cash generation have enabled an attractive dividend policy for the
shareholders.
In March 2023, ADNOC Distribution shareholders approved a new dividend policy which sets a minimum
dividend of AED 2.57 billion (20.57 fils per share) for 2023 (compared to a minimum 75% of distributable profits
as per the previous policy), yielding 5.8% (at a share price of AED 3.57 as of 6 February 2024) and offering
higher payback visibility for the shareholders.
ADNOC Distribution paid AED 1.285 billion dividends for the first six months of 2023 (10.285 fils per share) in
October 2023. On 6 February 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors recommended a dividend of AED 1.285
billion for the second six-months period of 2023, which is expected to be paid in April 2024, subject to the
shareholders’ approval.

Financial results
In Q4 2023, revenue increased by 16.8% year-on-
year to AED 9,564 million. The growth was driven
by higher fuel volumes, growing contribution of non-
fuel retail business and consolidation of
TotalEnergies Marketing Egypt, partially offset by
lower selling prices as a result of lower crude oil
prices.
Q4 2023 gross profit increased by 24.5% year-on-
year to AED 1,526 million, supported by higher fuel
volumes and growth in non-fuel retail business. In
addition, in Q4 2023 in a rising oil price environment
inventory gains amounted to AED 51 million (AED
76 million inventory gains in fuel retail and AED 25
million inventory losses in commercial business)
compared to inventory loss of AED 43 million in
commercial business in Q4 2022.
Q4 2023 EBITDA increased by 43.8% year-on-year
to AED 941 million supported by the higher fuel
volumes, as well as inventory gains in Q4 2023
compared to inventory losses in Q4 2022.
Q4 2023 underlying EBITDA (EBITDA excluding
inventory movements) increased by 27.7% year-on-
year to AED 890 million driven by the higher
volumes, growing contribution from non-fuel and
international activities as a well as management
initiatives to reduce costs.
Q4 2023 net profit attributable to shareholders
increased by 61.4% year-on-year to AED 677
million due to an increase in EBITDA and despite
higher finance costs. Q4 2023 net profit excluding
inventory movements increased by 35.5% year-on-
year to AED 626 million.
2023 revenue increased by 7.8% year-on-year to
AED 34,629 million despite lower selling prices as a
result of lower crude oil prices. The increase in
revenue was driven by growth in fuel volumes and
higher non-fuel business contribution as well as the
consolidation of TotalEnergies Marketing Egypt.
In 2023, gross profit increased by 3.0% year-on-
year to AED 5,836 million supported by higher
volumes and despite pressure on commercial
margins in a declining price environment.
In addition, in 2022 in a fast rising oil price
environment inventory gains amounted to AED 622
million (AED 489 million in fuel retail and AED 133
million in commercial business). In 2023, the
Company recorded lower inventory gains of AED
334 million in the fuel retail business and AED 6
million in the commercial business – total inventory
gains of AED 339 million.
2023 EBITDA increased by 4.6% year-on-year to
AED 3,680 million despite smaller inventory gains in
2023 compared to 2022.
2023 underlying EBITDA (EBITDA excluding
inventory movements) increased by 15.4% year-on-
year to AED 3,340 million, mainly driven by higher
fuel volumes as well as growing contribution from
non-fuel retail and international activities. In
addition, the management implemented efficiency
improvement initiatives which resulted in the
reduction of OPEX.
2023 net profit attributable to shareholders
decreased by 5.4% year-on-year to AED 2,601
million as a result of lower inventory gains year-on-
year. However, net profit excluding inventory
movements increased by 6.4% year-on-year to AED
2,262 million despite higher depreciation charge
and finance costs.

objectives, goals, strategies, future operational performance, and anticipated developments in markets in which
we operate and in which we may operate in the future. These forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and all of which are based on
management’s current beliefs and expectations about future events. Forward-looking statements are sometimes
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”,
“would”, “intends”, “estimates”, “plans”, “targets”, or “anticipates” or the negative thereof, or other comparable

UAE; failure to successfully implement our operating initiatives and growth plans, including our mixed-mode
service offering, our convenience store optimization initiatives, our cost savings initiatives, and our growth plans;
competition in our markets; decrease in demand for the fuels we sell, including due to general economic
conditions, improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preference for alternative fuels; the dangers
inherent in the storage and transportation of the products we sell; our reliance on information technology to
manage our business; laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection, operational safety, and
product quality; the extent of our related party transactions with ADNOC and our reliance on ADNOC to operate
our business; the introduction of VAT and other new taxes in the UAE; failure to successfully implement new
policies, practices, systems and controls that we implemented in connection with or following our IPO; any
inadequacy of our insurance to cover losses that we may suffer; general economic, financial and political
